                <b>PEACE OF MIND</b> - We created MaxLife Foods to create food storage that <b>stored as long as possible, tasted better, provided more food per serving, was more convenient to store & use, was easier to prepare, and was more affordable</b>.  We did just that.  Our delicious, gourmet, just-add-water food storage entrees are guaranteed to be the best price.
                <br><br><b>BEST VALUE</b> - Some competitors are so expensive that they won't even tell you their prices until they're in your home doing a demonstration and trying to upsell you.  You also may end up with <b>canned food that is hard to store, difficult to open, and unweildy once opened</b>.  Other food storage companies <b>claim packages with a high number of servings while using a lot of cheap fillers like drinks and desserts</b> that provide low caloric intake that is needed in an emergency.
					<br><br><b>U.S. PRODUCED</b> - Our food storage is 100% produced in the U.S. and 99% of the food is sourced from the U.S.  The other small percentage is for seasonal freshness.
					<br \><br \><b>CONVENIENT</b> - We are your one-stop shop for everything food storage.  Thought you didn't have the space or budget for a long-term, 1 year food storage option for your whole family?  For 2 adults and 4 kids you can fit your rationed supply in the same amount of space as a washer and dryer.  Use your long-term food storage for the food portion of a 72 hour emergency kit as well.  Just grab a 20 lb bucket full of a variety of individually packaged, airtight, nitrogen flushed meals and go.  For sportsmen, <strong>it doesn't get much easier than pulling pouch out of your backpack and adding water.</strong>

                    <b>Why is MaxLife better?</b> MaxLife food storage tastes better, is less expensive, provides more food per serving, has fewer fillers like drinks & desserts, is easier to prepare, and more convenient to store.  We are truly the best value in the industry.<br /><br />
                    <b>Financing?</b> Contact us for financing options if you want all the entire pack now, or we can put you on a monthly pay-as-you-go plan and send you buckets monthly.<br /><br />
						 <b>How much food does a person need daily?</b> This depends on the person, but we recommend 2000 calories per day on average for an adult.  In survival mode you can survive on less, but we recommend preparing based on this number. Even with our higher calories per serving than the competition, it takes about 8 servings to reach 2000 calories.<br \><br \>
						 <b>What is a "filler"?</b> Some food storage companies fill their packages with "filler" items like drink mixes, desserts, and non-meals such as plain rice.  These are cheap, but allow them to claim more servings per package.  With MaxLifeFoods.com you get more meal servings, not fluff.<br \><br \>
                    <b>How do I prepare a meal?</b> Simply add one cup of (preferably hot) water per serving. You can reuse resealable pouches to combine the food and water.  There is no cooking required unless you prefer your meal hot.<br /><br />
                    <b>Where/Temperature should I store it?</b> The garage is not usually a good place because of the fluctuation of temperature.  The cold does not adversely affect the shelf life, but temperatures above 75 degrees will. Store indoors where temperatures are more consistently maintained. Optimal storage conditions are in cool, dark, and dry places.<br /><br />
                    <b>How much water will I need?</b> On average, each individual serving of our main entrees and breakfasts require 1 cup of water per serving.<br /><br />                    
                    <b>Do you have to use boiling water?</b> Hot water speeds up the process of reconstitution.  Our meals will be ready to eat more quickly when hot water is used.  However, many of the entrees/breakfasts can be re-hydrated and ready to eat with any temperature of water.<br /><br />
                    <b>How is the food packaged?</b> 100% of our food is packaged in Mylar pouches.  These pouches are then arranged in durable polyethylene buckets for easy storage.  Oxygen Absorbers are also placed in each pouch to eliminate oxygen.<br /><br />
                    <b>How long does the food last?</b> Studies have proven that freeze-dried and dehydrated foods will last up to 25 years or even longer when stored correctly.  For optimal storage life it is suggested that food be stored in a cool, dry place, such as a basement, with room temperatures of 50 to 55 degrees.<br /><br />
                    <b>Does opening the bucket affect the shelf life of the pouches within?</b> No, the pouches have been designed to sustain long life by using mylar, nitrogen flushing and oxygen absorbers.  Opening the bucket does not affect shelf life of the pouches.  The bucket just creates a great way to hold and protect the pouches.<br /><br />
                    <b>How much food should we have stored for our family?</b> The needs of each family are different.  We offer a variety of options to meet your individual and family needs.  We offer packages and products based on number of servings.  We also provide the number of calories in each package.  From there you calculate how many servings of food needed for your family for any length of time.  We also offer supplementary products to enhance your food storage such as fruits, vegetables, meats, and nutritious drinks.<br /><br />
                    <b>Why use both freeze-dried and dehydrated ingredients?</b> We use a best of breed approach.  Certain ingredients set-up and taste better when freeze-dried (vegetables, fruits, meats) while others do better through dehydration.  In these cases dehydrated ingredients offer all the benefits and better value than foods that have only benn purely freeze-dried.<br /><br />
                    <b>Will I be notified of my product delivery?</b> Yes, you will receive an email regarding your order and delivery times.<br /><br />
						 <b>How do your products ship?</b> MaxLife products ship via UPS.<br><br>
                    <b>Can I order individual entrees in bulk?</b> No, sorry.<br /><br />

                    <b>Returns?</b> All sales are final.<br><br>
                    <b>Is it organic?</b> No.<br /><br />
                    <b>Is it gluten free?</b> No.<br /><br />
